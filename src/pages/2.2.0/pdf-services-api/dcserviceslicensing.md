# PDF Services API Licensing

## Paid programs

Adobe PDF Services API licensing is measured per Document Transaction
(previously known as PDF Transactions) which is based on the initial
endpoint request (i.e., API call) and the digital output, with each
operation in the table described below. Content limits apply and are
provided along with examples for clarity.

Paid credentials enable a greater processing quota and require entering
into a separate written agreement. To learn more, please see our
[pricing page](/document-services/pricing/#main)
for purchase options.

Document Transactions for the Operations below resulting in a Document
will be counted with the following page limits:

### Metrics

| Operation           | Capability                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Metric                               |

**Page limits may be lower for documents with a large number of tables.*

Licensing Metrics & Free Trial
------------------------------

The PDF Services API provides a free trial program so that you can take
a deep dive into its cool features at zero cost. Trial users that sign
up directly on Adobe I/O get free credentials that enable processing of
1,000 Document Transactions for up to 6 months. A Document Transaction
is based on the initial endpoint request (i.e., API call) and the
digital output. For detailed licensing metrics, please see the tables
above.

Processing is calculated on a per Document Transaction basis.

Example 1:

-   Converting a ten-page Word document into PDF consumes 1 Document
    Transaction of the trial quota.
-   1 (Operation: convert) x 1 (document) = 1 Document Transaction

Example 2:

-   Combining 20 single page documents into one PDF and then running OCR
    on the PDF consumes 2 Document Transactions of the trial quota.
-   1 (Operation: combine) x 1 (document) + 1 (Operation: OCR) x 1
    (document) = 2 Document Transactions

This generous allowance of processing power should allow you to get up
and running with the easy-to-use APIs with little investment.

Paid credentials enable a greater processing quota and require entering
into a separate written agreement. To learn more, please see our
[pricing page](/document-services/pricing/#main) for purchase options.
