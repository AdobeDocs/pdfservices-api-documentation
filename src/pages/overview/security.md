Security practices are deeply ingrained into our internal software development and operations processes and tools and are rigorously followed by our cross functional teams to prevent, detect, and respond to incidents in an expedient manner. Furthermore, our collaborative work with partners, leading researchers, security research institutions, and other industry organizations helps us keep up to date with the latest threats and vulnerabilities, and we regularly incorporate advanced security techniques into the products and services we offer.
