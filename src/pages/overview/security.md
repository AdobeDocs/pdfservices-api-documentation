### Adobe PDF Embed API
Adobe PDF Embed API allows you to embed a PDF viewer in your web applications with only a few lines of code. With options for controlling how a PDF appears and functions, your applications can deliver the rich and compelling digital document experiences to your customers expect and need.

### Adobe Commitment to Accessibility
[Adobe Accessibility Principles](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/09/26/announcing-adobes-new-accessibility-principles) align with our core values and form the foundation for what we believe — everyone should be able to create, interact, and engage with digital experiences. These principles will serve as our guideposts as we build thoughtful and inclusive technology that makes a difference in people’s lives.

The Adobe Accessibility Board has been created to set the strategy, review progress and oversee our commitment to supporting people with disabilities.
