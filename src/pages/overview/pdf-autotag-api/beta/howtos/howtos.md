# How Tos
<p>

The samples and documentation provide sample “Hello World” code that speeds development with the Autotag API. The service has options as follows:

- PDF Version :- There are 2 versions supported of pdf 1.7 and 2.0
- Generate Report :- It determines whether an excel report containing the information of the tagged pdf will be in the ouput or not
- Shift Headings :- It determines whether the headings of the pdf is to be shifted or not

For code examples illustrating other PDF actions including those below, see the [PDFServices SDK](../../../pdf-services-api/index.md) :

- Creating a PDF from multiple formats, including HTML, Microsoft Office documents, and text files
- Exporting a PDF to other formats or an image
- Combining entire PDFs or specified page ranges
- Using OCR to make a PDF file searchable with a custom locale
- Compress PDFs with compression level and Linearize PDFs
- Protect PDFs with password(s) and Remove password protection from PDFs
- Common page operations, including inserting, replacing, deleting, reordering, and rotating
- Splitting PDFs into multiple files

## Runtime in-memory authentication

The SDK supports providing the authentication credentials at runtime.
Doing so allows fetching the credentials from a secret server during
runtime instead of storing them in a file. Please refer the following
samples for details.

-   [Java](https://github.com/adobe/pdfservices-java-sdk-samples/blob/master/src/main/java/com/adobe/pdfservices/operation/samples/createpdf/CreatePDFWithInMemoryAuthCredentials.java)

## Custom timeout configuration

The APIs use inferred timeout properties and provide defaults. However,
the SDK supports custom timeouts for the API calls. You can tailor the
timeout settings for your environment and network speed. In addition to
the details below, you can refer to working code samples:

-   [Java](https://github.com/adobe/pdfservices-java-sdk-samples/blob/master/src/main/java/com/adobe/pdfservices/operation/samples/createpdf/CreatePDFWithCustomTimeouts.java)

### Java timeout configuration

Available properties:

-   **connectTimeout**: Default: 2000. The maximum allowed time in
    milliseconds for creating an initial HTTPS connection.
-   **socketTimeout**: Default: 10000. The maximum allowed time in
    milliseconds between two successive HTTP response packets.

Override the timeout properties via a custom `ClientConfig` class:

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="1" languages="Java" /> 

### 

```javascript
ClientConfig clientConfig = ClientConfig.builder()
    .withConnectTimeout(3000)
    .withSocketTimeout(20000)
    .build();
```
