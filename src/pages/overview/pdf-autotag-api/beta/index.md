**What is Autotag?**

[The PDF Autotag API](./howtos/autotag-api.md) is a cloud-based web service that uses Adobeâ€™s Sensei AI technology to automatically autotag a pdf and to output the generated tagged pdf and an optional report containing the information of the tags. The service has options as follows:

- PDF Version :- There are 2 versions supported of pdf 1.7 and 2.0.
- Generate Report :- It determines whether an excel report containing the information of the tagged pdf will be in the ouput or not.
- Shift Headings :- It determines whether the headings of the pdf is to be shifted or not.

The excel report generated will contain the information of the tags of the tagged pdf.

The PDF Autotag API provides a method for developers to autotag pdf so that it can be read by devices like ScreenReaders.
