# Legacy to Modern Viewer

Adobeâ€™s new modern PDF viewer is a reimagining of the look and feel of PDF viewing 
on web, desktop, mobile, and PDF integrations.  It introduces a new framework and 
workflows that better map to user mental models and enables a consistent user 
experience whether you are viewing a PDF in Adobe Acrobat or embedded on your website.

## Migration Guide

To migrate over Adobe's new modern PDF viewer, developers are required to use 
[viewer.js](https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk/viewer.js) script (line 11) in place of the previously used
[main.js](https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk/main.js) script. All APIs and callbacks will work as expected 
with significant improvement in user experience.
