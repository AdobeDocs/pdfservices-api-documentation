# Inline Images

Add inline images in the document through json data using the <img\> tag.

## How It Works

You can provide the input image url by making use of html img tag in json. 

JSON representation of the input data:

```json
{
  "ContentBlock": "This is a sample image - <img src=\"https://documentcloud.adobe.com/dc-docgen-app/assets/dc_icon.png\">"
}
```
![Representation of sample json data](../images/inlineImageJson.png)

In the above example, the tag <b>ContentBlock</b> contains an <b><img\></b> html tag with src value "https://canvasjs.com/wp-content/uploads/images/gallery/php-charts/overview/php-charts-graphs-index-data-label.png". This image will be downloaded and placed in the final document as shown below.

<b>Note:</b> Only https urls are supported as the value of src.
