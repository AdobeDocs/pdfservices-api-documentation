# Getting Started 

<p>
PDF Accessibility Auto-Tag API assists in the process of improving accessibility in individual PDFs via auto-tagging, adding document structure tags to the PDF file that are used to read a document's text and presenting it in a way that makes sense to users using assistive technology. The API is accessible through SDKs which help you get up and running quickly. Once you've received your developer credential, download and set up one of the sample projects. After you're familiar with the APIs, leverage the samples in your own server-side code.
</p>

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

The SDK only supports server-based use cases where credentials are saved securely in a safe environment. SDK credentials should not be sent to untrusted environments or end user devices.

## Step 1 : Getting the access token

PDF Services API endpoints are authenticated endpoints. Getting an access token is a two-step process :

1. **Get Credentials** Invoking PDF Services API requires an Adobe-provided credential. To get one, [click here](https://acrobatservices.adobe.com/dc-integration-creation-app-cdn/main.html?api=pdf-services-api), and complete the workflow. Be sure to copy and save the credential values to a secure location.
2. **Retrieve Access Token** The PDF Services APIs require an access_token to authorize the request. Use the "Get AccessToken" API from the Postman Collection with your client_id, client_secret (mentioned in the pdfservices-api-credentials.json file downloaded in 1) to get the access_token OR directly use the below mentioned cURL to get the access_token.

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="1" languages="REST API" /> 

### REST API

```javascript
curl --location 'https://pdf-services.adobe.io/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id={{Placeholder for Client ID}}' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret={{Placeholder for Client Secret}}'
```

## Step 2 : Uploading an asset 

After getting the access token, we need to upload the asset. Uploading an asset is a two-step process : 

1. First you need to get an upload pre-signed URI by using the following API.

You can read more about the API in detail [here](../../../apis/#operation/asset.uploadpresignedurl).

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="1" languages="REST API" /> 

### REST API 

```javascript
curl --location --request POST 'https://pdf-services.adobe.io/assets' \
--header 'X-API-Key: {{Placeholder for client_id}}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{Placeholder for token}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "mediaType": "{{Placeholder for mediaType}}"
}'
```

2. On getting a `200` response status from the above API, use the `uploadUri` field in the response body of the above API to upload the asset directly to the cloud provider using a PUT API call. You will also get an `assetID` field which will be used in creating the job.

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="1" languages="REST API" /> 

### REST API

```javascript
curl --location -g --request PUT 'https://dcplatformstorageservice-prod-us-east-1.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/b37fd583-1ab6-4f49-99ef-d716180b5de4?X-Amz-Security-Token={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Security-Token}}&X-Amz-Algorithm={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Algorithm}}&X-Amz-Date={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Date}}&X-Amz-SignedHeaders={{Placeholder for X-Amz-SignedHeaders}}&X-Amz-Expires={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Expires}}&X-Amz-Credential={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Credential}}&X-Amz-Signature={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Signature}}' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/pdf' \
--data-binary '@{{Placeholder for file path}}'
```

## Step 3 : Creating the job 

To create a job for the operation, please use the  `assetID` obtained in Step 2 in the API request body. On successful job submission you will get a status code of `201` and a response header `location` which will be used for polling. 

For creating the job, please refer to the corresponding API spec for the particular [PDF Operation](../../../apis).

## Step 4 : Fetching the status

Once the job is successfully created, you need to poll the at the `location` returned in response header of Step 3 by using the following API 

You can read more about the API in detail [here](../../../apis/#operation/pdfoperations.compresspdf.jobstatus).

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="1" languages="REST API" /> 

### REST API

```javascript
curl --location -g --request GET 'https://pdf-services.adobe.io/operation/compresspdf/{{Placeholder for job id}}/status' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {{Placeholder for token}}' \
--header 'x-api-key: {{Placeholder for client id}}'
```

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>
<div>
Instead of using the status API to check the job status, you have the option to receive job completion notifications through Webhook. For more information, please refer the <a href="../../pdf-services-api/howtos/webhook-notification/">documentation</a>.
</div>

## Step 5 : Downloading the asset 

On getting `200` response code from the poll API, you will receive a `status` field in the response body which can either be `in progress`, `done` or `failed`.

If the `status` field is `in progress` you need to keep polling the location until it changes to `done` or `failed`.

If the `status` field is `done` the response body will also have a download pre-signed URI in the `dowloadUri` field, which will be used to download the asset directly from cloud provider by making the following API call

You can read more about the API in detail [here](../../../apis/#operation/asset.get).

<CodeBlock slots="heading, code" repeat="1" languages="REST API" /> 

### REST API 

```javascript
curl --location -g --request GET 'https://dcplatformstorageservice-prod-us-east-1.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/b37fd583-1ab6-4f49-99ef-d716180b5de4?X-Amz-Security-Token={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Security-Token}}&X-Amz-Algorithm={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Algorithm}}&X-Amz-Date={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Date}}&X-Amz-SignedHeaders={{Placeholder for X-Amz-SignedHeaders}}&X-Amz-Expires={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Expires}}&X-Amz-Credential={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Credential}}&X-Amz-Signature={{Placeholder for X-Amz-Signature}}'
```

## There you go! Your job is completed in 5 simple steps.

### Java

Jump start your development by bookmarking or downloading the following key resources:

-   This document
-   [API reference (Javadoc)](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_java_docs)
-   [Java Sample code](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_java_samples)
-   [Java library](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_java_maven). The Maven project contains the .jar file.

#### Authentication

Once you complete the [Getting Credentials](https://documentservices.adobe.com/dc-integration-creation-app-cdn/main.html), a zip or json file automatically downloads that contains content whose structure varies based on whether you opted to download personalized code samples.

-   **Personalized Download**: Downloads the zip which contains `adobe-dc-pdf-services-sdk-java-samples` with a preconfigured `pdfservices-api-credentials.json` file.
-   **Non Personalized Download**: Downloads the `pdfservices-api-credentials.json` with your preconfigured credentials.

After downloading the zip, you can run the samples in the zip directly by setting up the two environment variables `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID` and `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET` by running the following cammands :

- **Windows:**
  - `set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>`
  - `set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>`

- **MacOS/Linux:**
  - `export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>`
  - `export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>`

**Example pdfservices-api-credentials.json file**

```json 
{
    "client_credentials": {
        "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
        "client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>"
    },
    "service_principal_credentials": {
       "organization_id": "<YOUR_ORGNIZATION_ID>"
    }
}
```

#### Setup a Java environment

1.  Install [Java 11 or above](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
2.  Run `javac -version` to verify your install.
3.  Verify the JDK bin folder is included in the PATH variable (method varies by OS).
4.  Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). You may use your preferred tool; for example:
    - **Windows:** Example: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/maven).
    - **Macintosh:** Example: `brew install maven`.

<InlineAlert slots="text" />

Maven uses pom.xml to fetch pdfservices-sdk from the public Maven repository when running the project. The .jar automatically downloads when you build the sample project. Alternatively, you can download the pdfservices-sdk.jar file, and configure your own environment.

##### Running the samples

The quickest way to get up and running is to download the code samples during the Getting Credentials workflow. These samples provide everything from ready-to-run sample code, an embedded credential json file, and pre-configured connections to dependencies.

1.  Download [the Java sample project](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_java_samples).
2.  Build the sample project with Maven: `mvn clean install`.
3.  Set the environment variables `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` by running the following commands :
- **Windows:**
  - `set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>`
  - `set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>`

- **MacOS/Linux:**
  - `export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>`
  - `export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>`
4.  Test the sample code on the command line.
5.  Refer to this document for details about running samples as well as the API Reference for API details.

<InlineAlert slots="text" />

Command line execution is not mandatory. You can import the samples Maven project into your preferred IDE (e.g. IntelliJ/Eclipse) and run the samples from there.

#### Verifying download authenticity

For security reasons you may wish to confirm the installer's authenticity. To do so,

1.  After installing the package, navigate to the `.jar.sha1` file.
2.  Calculate the hash with any 3rd party utility.
3.  Find and open PDF Services sha1 file. Note: if you're using Maven, look in the .m2 directory.
4.  Verify the hash you generated matches the value in the .sha1 file.

#### Logging

Refer to the API docs for error and exception details.

The SDK uses the [log4js API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/log4js) for logging. During execution, the SDK searches for config/pdfservices-sdk-log4js-config.json in the working directory and reads the logging properties from there. If you do not provide a configuration file, the default logging logs INFO to the console. Customize the logging settings as needed.

**log4js.properties file**

```json
{
  "appenders": {
    "consoleAppender": {
      "_comment": "A sample console appender configuration, Clients can change as per their logging implementation",
      "type": "console",
      "layout": {

}
```

#### Setup a Python environment

Running any sample or custom code requires the following steps:

1. Install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher.
2. Verify your installation by running this command: `python --version`.

<InlineAlert slots="text" />

pip uses requirements.txt file to fetch pdfservices-sdk from the public PyPi repository when running the project. The .whl automatically downloads when you build the sample project. Alternatively, you can download the pdfservices-sdk .whl file, and configure your own environment.


##### Running the samples

The quickest way to get up and running is to download the code samples during the Getting Credentials workflow. These samples provide everything from ready-to-run sample code, an embedded credential json file, and pre-configured connections to dependencies.

1. Download and extract the [Python sample project](https://github.com/adobe/pdfservices-python-sdk-samples).
2. Copy the downloaded zip to the directory that you set up for this project and unzip the files there.
3.  Set the environment variables `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` by running the following commands :
- **Windows:**
  - `set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>`
  - `set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>`

- **MacOS/Linux:**
  - `export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>`
  - `export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>`
4. Go to the project directory (which contains `requirements.txt` file) and setup a virtual environment.

```
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate # on windows, use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
```

5. Now build the sample project using this command in terminal: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Test the sample code on the command line.
7. Refer to this document for details about running samples as well as the API Reference for API details.
8. You can import the samples into your preferred IDE and run the samples from there or run the commands from the README.md file in terminal.

#### Verifying download authenticity

For security reasons you may wish to confirm the installer's authenticity. To do so,

1.  After downloading the package zip, run following command

###### To generate tagged PDF from the sample file

```javascript 
python src/autotagpdf/autotag_pdf.py
```

Note: The above commands run on the input file “autotagPdfInput.pdf” present in “src/main/resources” directory and generate result in “output” directory inside the project. If the output files already exist, the commands will report an error.

Other sample programs in the SDK let you try out API options including generating a tagging report, and shifting headings so that the document title is only H1.

## Public API

PDF Services API is accessible directly via REST APIs which requires Adobe-provided credential for authentication. Once you've completed the [Getting Credentials](https://acrobatservices.adobe.com/dc-integration-creation-app-cdn/main.html?api=pdf-accessibility-auto-tag-api) workflow, a zip file automatically downloads that contains content whose structure varies based on whether you opted to download personalized code samples. The zip file structures are as follows:

-   **Personalized Download**: Downloads the zip which contains `adobe-dc-pdf-services-sdk-java-samples` with a preconfigured `pdfservices-api-credentials.json` file.
-   **Non Personalized Download**: Downloads the `pdfservices-api-credentials.json` with your preconfigured credentials.

After downloading the zip, you can run the samples in the zip directly by setting up the two environment variables `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID` and `PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET` by running the following cammands :

- **Windows:**
  - `set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>`
  - `set PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>`

- **MacOS/Linux:**
  - `export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>`
  - `export PDF_SERVICES_CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>`

**Example pdfservices-api-credentials.json file**

```json 
{
    "client_credentials": {
        "client_id": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
        "client_secret": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>"
    },
    "service_principal_credentials": {
       "organization_id": "<YOUR_ORGNIZATION_ID>"
    }
}
```
