# Licensing and Usage Limits

Adobe PDF Services API licensing is measured per Document Transaction which is based on the initial
endpoint request (i.e., API call) and the digital output, with each
operation in the table described below. Usage limits apply and are provided along with examples for clarity. These limits do not apply to PDF Embed API.

Paid credentials enable a greater processing quota and require entering
into a separate written agreement. To learn more, please see the
[pricing page](/document-services/pricing/#main)
for purchase options.

| Create + Combine + Protect                     | Creating a 10-page PDF document from an HTML page, then combining the PDF into four other 5-page PDF documents, and finally password protecting all four PDF documents will consume nine Document Transactions. | 1 (Operation: create) x 1 (document) + 1 (Operation: combine) x 4 (documents) + 1 (Operation: export) x 4 (documents) = 9 Document Transactions |

### Usage Limits

| JSON file size (Document Generation,HTML to PDF and Import PDFForm) | 10MB        |
| Maximum Requests Per Minute                                         | 100 RPM** (Enterprise), <br /> 25 RPM (Free Tier)|

**Page limits may be lower for documents with a large number of tables.*

### Free Tier

------------------------------

The PDF Services API has a Free Tier so that you can take a deep dive
into its cool features at zero cost. Free Tier users get free credentials
that enable the processing of 500 Document Transactions per month.
A Document Transaction is based on the initial endpoint request (i.e., API call)
and the digital output. For detailed licensing metrics, please see the tables
above.

Processing is calculated on a per Document Transaction basis.

Example 1:

-   On March 20, you convert a ten-page Word document into PDF.  This consumes 1 Document Transaction of the Free Tier quota, leaving you with 499 Document Transactions available for consumption through March 31.
    - 1 (Operation: convert) x 1 (document) = 1 Document Transaction On April 1, your Free Tier quota resets to 500 Document Transactions.

Example 2:

-  Combining 20 single-page documents into one PDF and then running OCR on the PDF consumes 2 Document Transactions of the quota.
    - 1 (Operation: combine) x 1 (document) + 1 (Operation: OCR) x 1 (document) = 2 Document Transactions

This generous allowance of processing power should allow you to get up
and running with the easy-to-use APIs with little investment.

Paid credentials enable a greater processing quota and require entering
into a separate written agreement. To learn more, please see our
[pricing page](/document-services/pricing/#main) for purchase options.
