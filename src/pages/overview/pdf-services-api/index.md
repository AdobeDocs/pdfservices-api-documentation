# Overview
<p>

The Adobe PDF Services API provides modern cloud-based capabilities for PDF manipulation. The API is accessible through SDKs which help you get up and running quickly. Once you've received your developer credential, download and set up one of the sample projects. After you're familiar with the APIs, leverage the samples in your own server-side code.

The SDK only supports server-based use cases where credentials are saved securely in a safe environment. SDK credentials should not be sent to untrusted environments or end user devices.
