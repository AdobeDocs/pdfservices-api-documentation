# Technical Support 

## Feedback and forum

Customer feedback is particularly valuable as it helps the team validate
use cases, guide development, and troubleshoot issues. Comments and
questions are always welcome on the [Community
Forum](https://community.adobe.com/t5/Document-Cloud-SDK/bd-p/Document-Cloud-SDK).

## Version Support Policy

### SDK Support 

Adobe always recommends that you use the latest product version
(Major.Minor.Patch) since it is always the most functional and most
secure. To support existing applications that may take time to migrate,
The SDK team adheres to a support policy that ensures deployed versions
continue to function securely as follows:

-   Every Major/Minor Version is supported for one year after the
    release of a newer Major/Minor Version; that is a Major.Minor.X
    version reaches its end of life 1 year after the next Major/Minor
    Release. For example, If there are 1.2.0 (Minor), 1.3.0 (Minor) and
    2.0.0 (Major) releases in sequence then,
    -   1.2.0 becomes unsupported 1 year after the release of 1.3.0.
    -   1.3.0 becomes unsupported 1 year after the release of 2.0.0.
-   Security patches and critical bug fixes are generally provided for
    the last dot release of the supported major versions. For example,
    if supported versions are 1.2.1, 1.3.1 and 2.0.0, only the 1.3.1 and
    2.0.0 release would receive a security update. As a best practice,
    deployment on a supported major release should migrate to the last
    minor update for that release.

Once a version reaches its end of life, functionality may be deprecated and stop working.

### Public API Support 

With the evolution of our APIs, a new version of the API may contain
non-backward compatible changes and we recommend adoption of a new
version upon its release. The previous version of the API will be
supported for one year after the release of a new version. Adobe will
use reasonably commercial efforts to provide 12-monthsâ€™ notice of
deprecation, unless extenuating circumstances prompt a shorter notice
period. Notices will be updated from time to time here, and it is your
sole responsibility to check for updates from time to time. After the
deprecation notice, no new enhancements are made to the service. Adobe
reserves the right to modify, deprecate, or discontinue the service, in
whole or in part, at any time.
