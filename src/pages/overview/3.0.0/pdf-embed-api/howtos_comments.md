# Comments and Markup

The Embed API provides the capability to add comments to PDF documents
using the commenting and markup tools. You can add comments with add
text comment tool, sticky notes, highlights, drawing tool, strikethrough
and underline text. In addition to these tools, there is also an eraser
tool which can be used to erase parts of drawing annotations. In
addition to these, there are undo and redo tools available in the top
bar.

## Single line implementation

You can enable/disable commenting tools with a single line. Commenting
is enabled by *default* with the Embed API and the commenting tools are
displayed in the top bar. You can disable commenting by adding
`showAnnotationTools: false` (line 9) to the previewConfig object in the
embedded JavaScript.

```html
<div id="adobe-dc-view"></div>
<script src="https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk/viewer.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.addEventListener("adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready", function () {
   var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", divId: "adobe-dc-view"});
   adobeDCView.previewFile({
     content:{location: {url: "https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk-demo/PDFs/Bodea Brochure.pdf"}},
     metaData:{fileName: "Bodea Brochure.pdf"}
   }, {showAnnotationTools: false});
});
</script>

## Commenting feature overview

The basic commenting features supported by Embed API include:

-   Adding text comments, sticky notes, highlights, underlines,
    strikethroughs, drawing markups, etc.
-   Updating annotations
-   Removing annotations
-   Replying to annotations

All the annotation types provided by PDF Embed API deliver the following
functionality:

-   Support for adding replies to annotations so that document
    recipients can respond to the author’s original markup. All comments
    appear in the right-hand comments panel.
-   Adding or updating any annotation enables the **Save** or **Download** button.
-   Once saved, the annotation is added to the PDF and becomes part of
    the PDF buffer.

### Add text comments

Users can add freehand text anywhere on a PDF page as follows: Select
the **Add text comment** tool from the quick tools menu on the left-hand side, click on the page to place the cursor
and type in your desired text. Click outside the text box to add the
annotation. A comment with the same text also appears on the right-hand
comments panel. Features include:

-   Updating a text comment: Click on an existing text comment
    to edit the text or change any of the text attributes
    from the toolbar. You can change attributes such as color and font
    size of the text comment. **Note**: The display of the text size is
    relative to the PDF zoom level. Text can also be edited by clicking
    on the Edit option in the overflow menu for the associated comment
    in the comments panel.
-   Removing a text comment:
    -   Click any existing text comment in the PDF to open the toolbar, and
        choose **Delete**.
    -   Alternatively, click the overflow menu for the associated
        comment in the comments panel, and choose **Delete**.
-   Moving or resizing a text comment: Place the cursor on an
    existing text comment and move the text to a different
    location on the same PDF page. You can also drag one of the corner
    circles of the text box to resize.

annotation is saved to the PDF.

-   Parts of a single drawing or multiple drawings can be
    erased at the same time. The corresponding drawings are
    updated in the PDF.
-   If the entire drawing is erased, then that particular drawing 
    gets removed from the PDF.

## Annotations API overview

The annotations API supports programmatic importing, creating, deleting,
updating, and exporting both comments (sticky notes) and other types of
markup such as highlight, underline and strikethrough. The PDF Embed API provides two
configuration variables to enable and control annotations:

-   `enableAnnotationAPIs`: Default is *false*. *true* enables the APIs.
    The client's application passes the annotations and PDF buffer to
    the PDF Embed API which renders it in the browser.
-   `includePDFAnnotations`: Default is *false*. When *true*, the API
    displays existing annotations. Supported annotations can be modified
    and unsupported annotations are read only. Annotation modifications
    enable the **Save** or **Download** button so that add, update, and delete actions
    may be saved to the PDF.

<InlineAlert slots="text" />

When only `enableAnnotationAPIs` is *true*, adding or updating
annotations does not alter the original PDF content. When both these
variables are *true*, the APIs alter the original PDF.

Both variables may be passed as a preview configuration to the
`previewFile` API.

```
Preview configuration
{
  enableAnnotationAPIs: <Boolean, default=false>,
  includePDFAnnotations: <Boolean, default=false>
}
```
    
Since these variables interact with each other, there are several
scenarios:

1.  If the annotation APIs are not enabled
    (`enableAnnotationAPIs: false`), then `includePDFAnnotations` is
    ignored.
2.  If annotations APIs are enabled (`enableAnnotationAPIs: true`) and
    `includePDFAnnotations: false`, then:

> -   The PDF Embed API does not display existing annotations, but will
>     display new ones.
> -   Any annotation added or updated either from the UI or API is not
>     saved to the PDF buffer; therefore, no **Save** or **Download** button appears in
>     the top bar.

3.  If both `enableAnnotationAPIs` and `includePDFAnnotations` are
    *true*, then:

> -   Any existing annotation the PDF Embed API supports is displayed
>     and accessible through these APIs. Note that unsupported
>     annotations appear in read-only mode and are not accessible to the
>     APIs.
> -   Any annotation added or updated from UI or API is saved to the PDF
>     buffer, and the **Save** or **Download** button is enabled when the PDF has unsaved
>     changes.

## Annotation schema

Annotation data passed to or sent from any API should exist in a well
known and widely accepted standard format. In support of standards and
global adoption then, the PDF Embed API supports a strict subset of the
[Web Annotations Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) (a
W3C recommendation). The Web Annotations Data Model specification
provides comprehensive information about a resource or associations
between resources.

The PDF Embed API's annotation model therefore requires the following
key fields:

```javascript
{
  "@context": [
     "https://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld",
     "https://comments.acrobat.com/ns/anno.jsonld"
   ],
  "type": "Annotation",
  "id": <ANNOTATION_ID>,
  "bodyValue": String,
  "motivation": String,
  "stylesheet": {
     "type": "CssStylesheet",
     "value": <CSS_DEFINITION>,
  },
  "target": <target-node> OR <target-reply>,
  "creator": {
     "type": "Person",
     "name": String,
   },
  "created": DateTime,
  "modified": DateTime,
}
```

*Annotations data parameters*

If the annotation is a comment on the PDF, then the value of the
`target` parameter is *target-node* as follows:

```javascript
{
 "source": <FILE_ID>,
 "selector": {
   "type": "AdobeAnnoSelector",
   "subtype" : "note" | "strikeout" | "highlight" | "underline" | "shape",
   "node": {
      "index": <PAGE_INDEX>
   },
   "boundingBox" : [Xmin, Ymin, Xmax, Ymax],
   "quadPoints" : [ .... ],
   "inkList" : [ [...], [...], ... ],
   "strokeColor": <COLOR_HEX_CODE>,
   "strokeWidth": Float,
   "opacity": Float (from 0.0 to 1.0),
   "styleClass": String
 }
}
```

If the annotation is a reply to an existing annotation, then the value
of the `target` parameter is *target-reply* which contains a single
parameter denoting the annotation ID of the parent annotation (the
annotation associated with the current reply):

```javascript
{
 "source": <ANNOTATION_ID>,
}
```

## Annotations interface


In order to invoke any annotations API, the PDF Embed API provides the
`AnnotationManager` interface. You can invoke all the APIs from this
interface. Before using this interface, you must set
`enableAnnotationAPIs` to *true* and pass it as a preview configuration
to the `previewFile` API.

Invoke the APIs with the `annotationManager` as follows:

```html
<html>
<head>
 <title>Adobe Document Cloud PDF Embed API Sample</title>
 <meta charset="utf-8"/>
 <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1"/>
 <meta id="viewport" name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
</head>

<body style="margin: 0px">
 <div id="adobe-dc-view"></div>
 <script src="https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk/viewer.js"></script>
 <script type="text/javascript">
 document.addEventListener("adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready", function()
 {
  var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", divId: "adobe-dc-view"});
  var previewFilePromise = adobeDCView.previewFile({
   content:   {location: {url: "https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk-demo/PDFs/Bodea Brochure.pdf"}},
   metaData:  {fileName: "Bodea Brochure.pdf", id: "77c6fa5d-6d74-4104-8349-657c8411a834"}
  },
  {
   enableAnnotationAPIs: true,
  });

  previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
   adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
    // All annotation APIs can be invoked here
   });
  });
 });
 </script>
</body>
</html>
```

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

When you enabled the annotation APIs, you must pass a PDF ID in the
metadata field when invoking the `previewFile` API. This ID uniquely
identifies the PDF so that annotations can be added.

```javascript
adobeDCView.previewFile({
   content:   {location: {url: "https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk-demo/PDFs/Bodea Brochure.pdf"}},
   metaData:  {fileName: "Bodea Brochure.pdf", id: "77c6fa5d-6d74-4104-8349-657c8411a834"}
}
```

## Basic APIs for commenting

The PDF Embed API offers several APIs which allow you to programatically
add, import, export, delete, and update annotations.

### addAnnotations API

This API adds or imports (only) supported annotations. It takes a JSON
array as input which contains the annotation data. The annotation data
must be in the specified in the [Annotation schema](#annotation-schema). Either a single annotation or
multiple annotations can be added.

#### Input parameters

A JSON array containing the list of annotations: `[Annotation_1, Annotation_2, ...]`

#### API output

Returns a Promise which:

* Resolves on a successful API operation
* Rejects with error object including code and message on API failure.

#### API signature

```javascript
const list_of_annotations = [Annotation_1, Annotation_2, ...];

previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
        adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
                        annotationManager.addAnnotations(list_of_annotations)
                                        .then(() => console.log("Success"))
                                        .catch(error => console.log(error));
         });
});
```

<hr />

### getAnnotations API

This API exports and receives PDF annotation data based on the filter
provided by the client. The annotations are returned in the form of a
JSON array, and the annotation data will be in the format as described
in the [Annotation schema](#annotation-schema).

#### Input parameters

* If no filter is provided, then data for all of the annotations is returned.
* If a list of annotation IDs is passed in the filter, then only the annotations matching those IDs is returned.
* If page range is passed in the filter, then only the annotations in those pages is returned.

```javascript
filter = {
        annotationIds:
                [Annotation_ID_1, Annotation_ID_2, ...],
        pageRange:{
                startPage: <Page_Number>,
                endPage: <Page_Number>
        },
}
```

#### API output

Returns a Promise which:

* Resolves with a list of annotations on success,
* Rejects with an error object which includes a code and message on operation failure.

#### API signature

```javascript
const filter = {
        // annotationIds: [Annotation_ID_1, Annotation_ID_2, ...];
        // OR,
        // pageRange: {startPage: <Page_Number>, endPage: <Page_Number>};
}


previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
        adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
                        annotationManager.getAnnotations(filter)
                                        .then (result => console.log(result))
                                        .catch(error => console.log(error));
 });
});
```

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

If `includePDFAnnotations` is set to *true*, then any existing
annotation in PDF which the PDF Embed API supports is accessible
through the annotation APIs. The data for these annotations can be
received through the GET API. Note that the ID of such annotations
received in the GET API output will be different for every browser
session.

<hr />

### deleteAnnotations API

This API deletes PDF annotations based on the filter provided by the
client.

#### Input parameters

* If no filter is provided, then all the PDF annotations are deleted.
* If a list of annotation IDs is passed in the filter, then only the annotations matching those IDs are deleted. The other annotations will remain.
* If a page range is passed in the filter, then only the annotations in those pages are deleted. The other annotations remain.

```javascript
filter = {
  annotationIds:
     [Annotation_ID_1, Annotation_ID_2, ...],
  pageRange:{
     startPage: <Page_Number>,
     endPage: <Page_Number>
  }
}
```

#### API output

Returns a Promise which:

* Resolves on successful delete operation
* Rejects with error object including code and message on delete operation failure.

#### API signature

```javascript
const filter = {
        // annotationIds: [Annotation_ID_1, Annotation_ID_2, ...];
        // OR,
        // pageRange: {startPage: <Page_Number>, endPage: <Page_Number>};
}

previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
        adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
                        annotationManager.deleteAnnotations(filter)
                                        .then (() => console.log("Success"))
                                        .catch(error => console.log(error));
 });
});
```

<hr />

### updateAnnotation API

This API updates a single existing annotation in the PDF, including the
parameter `bodyValue`, parameters `font` and `color` under `stylesheet`,
as well as other parameters under `selector` such as `strokeColor`,
`strokeWidth`, `boundingBox` and `inkList`.

This API takes the annotation data containing the updated parameters,
finds the annotation with the ID present in the input data, and applies
the update to that annotation. The annotation data must be in the same
format as described in the Annotation schema.

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

You can update the `boundingBox` parameter only for note, add text and
drawing annotations using this API.

#### Input parameters

JSON object containing the annotation data.

#### API output

Returns a Promise which:

* Resolves on successful update operation,
* Rejects with error object including code and message on update operation failure.

#### API signature

```javascript
const annotation_data = <Annotation_Data>;

previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
        adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
                        annotationManager.updateAnnotation(annotation_data)
                                        .then (()=> console.log("Success"))
                                        .catch(error => console.log(error));
 });
});
```

<hr />

## Annotation events

Website developers can receive events when a user action interacts with
an annotation. These events are generated for annotation actions
performed through the UI as well as through the annotation APIs.

There are two ways to capture these events: use either the Events
callback or the `annotationManager` interface.

### Events callback usage

Register the events callback and enable the flag
`enableAnnotationEvents` to receive these events.

For details, see [Annotation events](./howtodata.md#annotation-events)

### annotationManager interface

The `annotationManager` interface listens for events via the
`registerEventListener` API. To receive specific event types, pass the
list of event types in the `listenOn` parameter. If nothing is passed to
`listenOn`, then all the annotation events return.

Note that the events are generated through this interface only when
annotation APIs are enabled.

```javascript
const eventOptions = {
  // Pass the events to receive.
  // If no event is passed in listenOn, then all the annotation events will be received.
  listenOn: [
      "ANNOTATION_ADDED", "ANNOTATION_CLICKED"
  ]
}

previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
  adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
      annotationManager.registerEventListener(
          function(event) { console.log(event.type, event.data) },
          eventOptions
      );
   });
});
```


Possible annotations events appear in the following table. The event
data contains the data of the annotation in JSON format on which the
event gets triggered.

*Event types*

| Event type                | Description                                                                                                                                                     | Event data                |

## Handling existing annotations

The PDF Embed API provides two additional APIs that remove existing
annotations or save new annotations. These APIs only function when
`includePDFAnnotations` is *true*.

### removeAnnotationsFromPDF API

This API deletes all annotations and returns both a list of the removed
annotations as well as the PDF buffer as output. Note that the API can
only remove supported annotations.

#### Input parameters

N/A


#### API output

Returns a Promise which:

* Resolves with both a list of removed annotations as well as an updated PDF buffer if the operation succeeds.
* Rejects with an error object that includes both an error code and message on operation failure.

#### API signature

```javascript
previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
        adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
                        annotationManager.removeAnnotationsFromPDF()
                                        .then(result => console.log(result))
                                        .catch(error => console.log(error));
         });
});
```

<hr />

### addAnnotationsInPDF API

This API takes a list of supported annotations as input and saves those
annotations to the PDF buffer. The updated PDF buffer is returned as API
output.

#### Input parameters

A JSON array of annotation data: `[Annotation_1, Annotation_2, ...]`

#### API output

Returns a Promise which:

* Resolves with the updated PDF buffer if the operation succeeds.
* Rejects with an error object that includes both an error code and message on operation failure.

                                        .catch(error => console.log(error));
         });
});
```

<hr />

## APIs to control UI configurations

UI control is available through the following APIs:

-   `setConfig`: enable and disable UI elements
-   `selectAnnotation`: Select and shift focus to an annotation
-   `unselectAnnotation`: Unselect an annotation
-   `startAnnotationMode`: Enter annotation mode
-   `endAnnotationMode`: Exit from annotation mode

### setConfig API

`setConfig` allows you to set special UI configurations, including
hiding the annotation tools from the left-hand side, hiding the right-hand
comments panel, hiding the toolbar on text selection, and enabling the
downloaded and printed PDF to contain annotations even when unsaved to
the PDF buffer.

The API supports the following flags. You can pass 1-N flags to the API
as needed:

-   `showToolbar`: This flag shows or hides the add text, sticky note,
    highlight, strikethrough, underline, drawing and eraser tools on the left-hand side. 
    The default value is *true*, and these annotation tools are visible. Set this
    flag to false if these tools need to be hidden.
-   `showCommentsPanel`: This flag shows or hides the right-hand
    comments panel. The default value is *true*, and the comments panel is
    visible. Set to *false* to hide the right-hand comments panel.
-   `showToolsOnTextSelection`: This flag shows or hides the toolbar
    available on text selection. The default value is *true*, and the
    toolbar is visible. Set to *false* to hide the toolbar.

![Drawing Tools with optin to showToolbar and showCommentsPanel](../images/drawingtools1.png)
<br/>

-   `downloadWithAnnotations`: Annotations are not saved to the PDF
    buffer if annotation APIs are enabled. By default, the downloaded
    PDF will not contain any annotation. Set to *true* to download the
    PDF with all the annotations.
-   `printWithAnnotations`: Annotations will no longer be saved to the
    PDF buffer if annotations APIs are enabled. By default, the print
    does not contain any annotation. Set to *true* to print the PDF with
    all the annotations.

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

You can set and pass these flags to either `setConfig` or
`previewFile` as shown below.

**Method 1: Pass the flags to setConfig**

#### Input parameters

The list of flags and the corresponding Boolean values.

```javascript
{
       showToolbar: <Boolean, Default=true>,
       showCommentsPanel: <Boolean, Default=true>,
       downloadWithAnnotations: <Boolean, Default=false>,
       showToolsOnTextSelection: <Boolean, default=true>,
       printWithAnnotations: <Boolean, Default=false>
}
```

#### API output

Returns a Promise which:

* Resolves on success of operation
* Rejects with error object including code and message on failure.

#### API signature

```javascript
const customFlags = {
   showToolbar: <Boolean, Default=true>,
   showCommentsPanel: <Boolean, Default=true>,
   downloadWithAnnotations: <Boolean, Default=false>,
   showToolsOnTextSelection: <Boolean, default=true>,
   printWithAnnotations: <Boolean, Default=false>,
}

previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
   adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
       annotationManager.setConfig(customFlags)
           .then(() => console.log("Success"))
           .catch(error => console.log(error));
   });
});
```

**Method 2: Pass the flags to previewFile**

As an alternative to passing to `setConfig`, add the flags to the
`annotationUIConfig` object that's passed as a preview configuration to
the previewFile API.

```javascript
annotationUIConfig: {
  showToolbar: <Boolean, default=true>,
  showCommentsPanel: <Boolean, default=true>,
  showToolsOnTextSelection: <Boolean, default=true>,
  downloadWithAnnotations: <Boolean, default=false>,
  printWithAnnotations: <Boolean, default=false>
}
```

### selectAnnotation API

This API selects any existing annotation and shifts the focus to the
selected annotation. It applies the select operation to the annotation
specified by the annotation ID.

#### Input parameters

<Annotation_ID>

#### API output

Returns a Promise which:

* Resolves on successful select annotation operation
* Rejects with error object including an error code and message

#### API signature

```javascript
const annotation_ID = <Annotation_ID>;

previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
   adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
    annotationManager.selectAnnotation(annotation_ID)
        .then(() => console.log("Success"))
        .catch(error => console.log(error));
  });
});
```

  adobeViewer.getAnnotationManager().then(annotationManager => {
    annotationManager.unselectAnnotation();
 });
});
```

<hr />

### startAnnotationMode API

This API starts a particular annotation mode so that you can annotations
of that type or use the eraser tool. The API takes a single annotation
mode as input. The annotation mode can be any one of the supported
annotation types in PDF Embed API, and it supports the following
optional parameters:

-   `defaultColor`: A hex code specifying the annotation color. This
    parameter is applicable for all annotation types.
-   `cursor`: A [CSS standards-based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor)
    string value to denote the cursor style on annotation start. This
    parameter is applicable for all annotation types.
-   `fontSize`: Font size within the range of 6-24px. This parameter is
    applicable only in case of add text annotations.
-   `strokeWidth`: Stroke width within the range of 1-12, to set the
    line thickness of the drawing annotation.
    
#### Input parameters

There are two parameters which accept the following values:

* `mode`: Permissible values include: note, highlight, shape, underline, strikeout, freetext or eraser
* `options`: defaultColor: <COLOR_HEX_CODE>, cursor: <CURSOR_TYPE>, fontSize: <FONT_SIZE>, strokeWidth: <STROKE_WIDTH>

#### API output

Returns a Promise which:

* Resolves on successful start annotation mode operation
* Rejects with an error object including a code and message

#### API signature

```javascript
// Add text annotation
const mode = "freetext";
const options = {
  defaultColor: "#b80000",
  cursor: "crosshair",
  fontSize: "15px"
};

// Drawing annotation
/* const mode = "shape";
