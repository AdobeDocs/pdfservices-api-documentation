# Version - Support policy

This document describes the PDF Services SDK's and Public API's
versioning and support policies.

## SDK

### Versioning scheme

The SDK has a version format of \#.\#.\# (e.g. 1.1.0) where the numbers
correspond to a major release, minor release, and patch/update
(Major.Minor.Patch). Releases are defined as follows:

-   **Major Releases (1.x.x)**: Major releases introduce
    backward-incompatible changes to the APIs and interfaces and start
    the EOL clock for all previous releases. Developers should plan on
    migrating their code prior to the end of life of the previous major
    release.
-   **Minor Releases (x.1.x)**: Minor releases typically appear
    quarterly. Changes are backward compatible to the last major
    release. Minor releases introduce new interfaces. Existing
    interfaces continue to function but some interfaces may be
    deprecated; deprecated interfaces will be removed in a next major
    release.
-   **Patch Releases (x.x.1)**: Patch releases only deliver critical
    security or bug fixes as needed. Patch release changes are rolled
    into the next minor release so that developers can update and deploy
    new code based on their business requirements.

## Public API

### Versioning

As mentioned on [Public API
Docs](../../apis),
each operation has a unique assetId which is passed in Form Parameters.
Generally, APIs will be enhanced while keeping them backward compatible.
If its functionality can't be enhanced without breaking changes, then
its new version will be released with its own unique assetId. The
supported older API versions info will be present on [Public API
Docs](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/document-services/index.html)

Additionally, the output for the PDF Extract API is generated by a
machine learning pipeline that is frequently trained to improve
inference of document layout and structure.As a result, while changes to
the output structure are not expected between versions, specific results
may vary as the model output improves.

## Supported versions

This document as well as the URLs on Adobe's website and other
documentation link to the latest product version.

**Note**: Links to repository assets (e.g. GIT, Maven, etc.) direct to
the top level directory. To download assets that match the
documentation, navigate to the correct version. For example, When using
the 1.0.0 Java documentation, you can find the 1.0.0 samples in the GIT
repo as follows:

1.  Go to the [GIT repo](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_java_samples).
2.  Select *Releases*.
3.  Select and download the needed release.

## Migration Guide to PDF Services SDK

Refer to the following table for migrating to PDF Services SDK version
3.4.0, you can also refer our Samples(
[Java](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdftoolsapi_java_samples), [Node

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

The 1.X.X versions of PDF Tools SDK will be reaching End of Life in
May 2022. Once a version reaches its end of life, functionality may be
deprecated and stop working. Please upgrade to use our latest SDK
version.

### Java changes
