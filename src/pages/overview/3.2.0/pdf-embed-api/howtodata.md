# Analytics

## Adobe Analytics

If your organization already subscribes to Adobe Analytics, rich PDF
analytics is yours by default. You should use Analytics as you normally
would; however, there are a few setup steps required to correctly map
the incoming data to Adobe Analytics variables.

### Set up the PDF Viewer

Since you want to track user interaction with the PDF viewer, you need
to make sure events appear in the correct report suites. To
automatically receive PDF analytics events, pass the Analytics report
suite ID when creating the `AdobeDC.View` instance. You must ensure that
Adobe Analytics is instrumented using the same `reportSuiteId` for the
website where you are embedding the PDF Viewer.

```javascript
var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({
    clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
    divId: "adobe-dc-view"
    reportSuiteId: "<YOUR_Adobe_Analytics_REPORT_SUITE ID>",
    ...
})
```

Find the code sample for Adobe Analytics integration 
in PDF Embed API [here](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdfembedapi_samples) under
`/More Samples/Analytics/Adobe Analytics`.

### Configure Adobe Analytics

The current release requires a few configuration steps to correctly map
PDF Embed API data collected from your PDF viewer to your report suite.
Once you've logged in to Analytics, do the following:

Once you've logged in to Analytics, do the following:

1.  In the top menu, go to **Admin > Report Suites**.
2.  Select your report suite.

![Selecting Site Title as DC SDK PDF Viewer Metrics in AEM Suite](../images/aemsuite.png)
<br/>

3.  Navigate to the Report Suite Manager.
4.  Highlight your report suite.
5.  Choose **Edit Settings > General > Processing Rules**.

![Selecting Processing Rules from AEM Edit Settings Menu](../images/aemeditsettingsmenu.png)
<br/>

6.  Click the **Processing Rules** tab. You'll need to create two rules
    and configure them so that you can map collected events and event
    attributes to Analytics variables.

![Setting up AEM Processing Rules on event dimensions and events](../images/aemprocessingrules.png)

#### Mapping event attibutes

You'll need to create a new rule and map event attributes sent by the
PDF Embed API to an Adobe Analytics variable. For example, an event
attribute might be something like a page number or title. There could be
many events with the same attribute (one for each event happening on a
specific page). The following attributes eventually become dimensions in
your reports:

-   a.dc.searchTerm
-   a.action
-   a.dc.pageNum
-   a.dc.filename

Map event attributes as follows:

1.  Choose **Add Rule**.
2.  Add a custom rule title such as "Event Dimensions".
3.  Choose **Add Action** until you have four (one for each attribute
    above).
4.  Select an item (event attribute) from the **With** drop down list
    (one of those above).
5.  Select an Analytics dimension variable from the drop down list on
    the left.
6.  The left hand columns should remain set to "Overwrite value of".
7.  Repeat the above steps for each incoming event attribute you track.

![AEM Dim Map with dimension variable and incoming event attribute field set](../images/aemdimmap.png)

#### Mapping events

Create another new rule and map events sent by the PDF Embed API to an
Adobe Analytics variable. Note that Analytics uses "metrics" and
"events" interchangeably. An event is any user interaction your
JavaScript event listener captures; for example, clicking on a button or
commenting on a PDF. The following events eventually become metrics
displayed in your reports:

-   a.dc.zoomLevel
-   a.dc.loadPDF
-   a.dc.viewPage
-   a.dc.download
-   a.dc.search
-   a.dc.bookmarkClicked
-   a.dc.copyText
-   a.dc.print

Map events as follows:

1.  Choose **Add Rule**.
2.  Add a custom rule title such as "Events".
3.  Choose **Add Action** until you have eight (one for each attribute
    above).
4.  Select a metric (an event) from the **To** drop down list (one of
    those above).
5.  Select an Analytics event variable from the drop down list on the
    left.
6.  The left hand column should remain set to "Set event".
7.  Repeat the above steps for each metric (incoming event).

## Google Analytics

If your website is already integrated with Google Analytics, you can collect PDF analytics 
from PDF Embed API in Google Analytics with a few simple setup steps. 

### Set up the PDF Viewer

Since you want to track user interaction with the PDF viewer, 
you need to make sure events appear in the correct Google Analytics property. 
To automatically receive PDF analytics events, pass the **Google Analytics 4 
measurement ID** when creating the `AdobeDC.View` instance. 
You must ensure that Google Analytics is instrumented using the same 
measurement ID for the website where you are embedding the PDF Viewer.

<InlineAlert slots="text" />

PDF analytics can only be collected in Google Analytics 4 property.
Analytics collection in Universal Analytics is not supported in the
current implementation.

```javascript
var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({
    clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
    divId: "adobe-dc-view"
    measurementId: "<YOUR_GA4_MEASUREMENT ID>",
    ...
})
```

*Following PDF analytics will be tracked:*

### Configure Google Analytics

The current release requires a few configuration steps to correctly map 
PDF Embed API data collected from your PDF viewer to Google Analytics.

### Custom Dimensions

You need to set up some custom dimensions in the Google Analytics 4 property, 
that will map to the attributes which are part of the event data sent by PDF Embed API.

Once you've logged in to Google Analytics, do the following:

1.  From the top bar, select the Google Analytics 4 property which contains your **measurement ID**.
2.  Click **Custom definitions** under **Configure** (in the left navigation pane).
3.  Click **Create custom dimensions**.

![Configure in GA4](../images/ga_create_dimension.png)
<br/>

4.  Enter Dimension name.
5.  Set the scope as **Event**.
6.  Enter a  description for this custom dimension.
7.  Enter the name of the event attribute sent from PDF Embed API. Custom dimensions need to be created for these event attributes: **filename**, **pageNum**, **searchTerm** and **zoomLevel**.
8. Click Save. 
(Note: You will see a value of "Not set" for a custom dimension during the first 48 hours. )

9. You need to set up four custom dimensions, as follows:

  * File Name 
  * Page Number 
  * Search Term, and, 
  * Zoom Level 

10. Map these custom dimensions with the correct event attributes sent from PDF Embed API, as shown in the table below:

| Dimension name | Scope                                                                     |  User property/parameter    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  ----------------------------- |
| File name | Event |                filename                |
| Page number    | Event        |                                  pageNum  |
| Search term    | Event         |                                  searchTerm  |
| Zoom level    | Event         |                                   zoomLevel |

If your website subscribes to both Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics, 
then analytics will be collected only in Adobe Analytics and no PDF analytics 
data would be sent to Google Analytics. 

## Control analytics collection

If your website is already integrated with analytics tools such as Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics, 
then you can collect PDF analytics with few additional setup steps. 
To know more about the setup steps, see the sections [Adobe Analytics](./howtodata.md#adobe-analytics) and [Google Analytics](./howtodata.md#google-analytics).

The `sendAutoPDFAnalytics` configuration controls the PDF analytics collection in these tools. 
The default value of `sendAutoPDFAnalytics` is *true*. 
Set this configuration to *false* if you would like to disable PDF analytics collection. 

```javascript
var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({
    clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
    divId: "adobe-dc-view"
    sendAutoPDFAnalytics: false,
    ...
})
```

## Default analytics

If you are not subscribed to Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics, you can still collect PDF
analytics events as users interact with PDFs. You enable PDF analytics
events by registering a callback with the API to listen the events.
Tracking PDF events provides insight into user actions and thereby helps
you manage and evolve the PDF experience you're delivering to customers.

As always, initialize the `AdobeDC.View` object with your client ID, and
then invoke the `previewFile` API on `AdobeDC.View` object as usual.
Finally, register the callback to receive the events and set
`enablePDFAnalytics` to *true*:

```javascript
const eventOptions = {
  //Pass the PDF analytics events to receive.
  //If no event is passed in listenOn, then all PDF analytics events will be received.
  listenOn: [ AdobeDC.View.Enum.PDFAnalyticsEvents.PAGE_VIEW, AdobeDC.View.Enum.PDFAnalyticsEvents.DOCUMENT_DOWNLOAD],
  enablePDFAnalytics: true
}

adobeDCView.registerCallback(
  AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.EVENT_LISTENER,
  function(event) {
    console.log("Type " + event.type);
    console.log("Data " + event.data);
  }, eventOptions
);
```

Find the working example in the [samples
repo](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdfembedapi_samples) under
`/More Samples/Capture PDF Embed API Events/`.

## Basic events

In addition to the PDF analytics events, the PDF Embed API supports
events which provide insight into user actions taken related to file
preview. These events can be received through the events callback. After

In order to receive additional file preview events, set
`enableFilePreviewEvents` to *true* and pass it to the events callback.
To receive specific events, pass the list of event types in the
`listenOn` parameter. If nothing is passed to `listenOn`, then the API
returns all the file preview events.

```javascript
const eventOptions = {
     //Pass the events to receive.
     //If no event is passed in listenOn, then all file preview events will be received.
     listenOn: [ AdobeDC.View.Enum.Events.APP_RENDERING_START, AdobeDC.View.Enum.FilePreviewEvents.PREVIEW_KEY_DOWN,  AdobeDC.View.Enum.FilePreviewEvents.PREVIEW_PAGE_VIEW_SCROLLED ],
     enableFilePreviewEvents: true
}

adobeDCView.registerCallback(
     AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.EVENT_LISTENER,
     function(event) {
        console.log(event)
     }, eventOptions
);
```

## Annotation events

Web developers can receive events when a user interacts with an
annotation. These events are generated for annotation actions performed
through the UI.

To register the events callback, set `enableAnnotationEvents` to *true*
and pass it to the callback. To receive specific events, pass the list
of annotation event types in the `listenOn` parameter. If nothing is
passed to `listenOn`, then the API returns all the annotation events.

```javascript
const eventOptions = {
   //Pass the events to receive.
   //If no event is passed in listenOn, then all annotation events will be received.
   listenOn: [ AdobeDC.View.Enum.AnnotationEvents.ANNOTATION_ADDED, AdobeDC.View.Enum.AnnotationEvents.ANNOTATION_UPDATED ],
   enableAnnotationEvents: true
 }

 adobeDCView.registerCallback(
   AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.EVENT_LISTENER,
   function(event) {
     console.log(event.type, event.data)
   }, eventOptions
 );
```
