UI Customization
================

<p>

The Embed API provides a number of options for customizing the user
interface and user interactions with the PDF. Features which are enabled
by default can be explicitly disabled.
Optional configurations include
controls for:
-   Enabling and disabling commenting, form filling, and other user
    interactions (applicable only in Full Window embed mode).
-   Enabling and disabling PDF download and print options.
-   Modifying the PDF display to Fit Page or Fit Width (applicable in
    Full Window and Lightbox embed modes).

</p>

## Menu and tool options

You can control various options provided by PDF Embed API and
customize the PDF viewer as per your requirements.

Initialize the `AdobeDC.View` object with your client ID and
then invoke the `previewFile` API on `AdobeDC.View` object.
The `previewFile` API reads the variable values and toggles 
features on and off accordingly.

In the example below, the embed mode is set as `FULL_WINDOW` and the download PDF option is disabled from the
overflow menu in the top bar in full window embed mode with `showDownloadPDF` set to *false*. The
PDF zoom control options are disabled with `showZoomControl` set to *false*.

**Example**

```html
<div id="adobe-dc-view"></div>
<script src="https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk/viewer.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
// Store the UI options in a constant
const previewConfig = {
   embedMode: "FULL_WINDOW",
   showDownloadPDF: false,
   showZoomControl: false
}

document.addEventListener("adobe_dc_view_sdk.ready", function () {
   var adobeDCView = new AdobeDC.View({clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>", divId: "adobe-dc-view"});
   // Consume previewConfig here. . .
   adobeDCView.previewFile({
      content:{location: {url: "https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk-demo/PDFs/Bodea Brochure.pdf"}},
      metaData:{fileName: "Bodea Brochure.pdf"}
   }, previewConfig);
});
</script>
```

## Callbacks & workflows

The PDF Embed API supports workflow customization via callbacks. By
registering callbacks with specified parameters, website developers can
control workflows related to saving files, user profiles, user settings,
and so on.

Every callback requires the following three parameters:

-   Callback type: One of SAVE\_API, STATUS\_API, GET\_USER\_PROFILE,
    GET\_USER\_SETTING\_API, or SET\_USER\_SETTING\_API
-   Function: A JavaScript function which returns a promise.
-   Options: Additional options passed to the callback to control its
    behaviour in certain scenarios.

You can only register one callback per type; for example, you can
register one callback for save and one for status.

`AdobeDC.View` exposes `registerCallback`, so the code looks something
like:

```javascript
adobeDCView.registerCallback(
  <Callback Type>,
  <Function>,
  options
);
```
    

The second parameter is a function which returns a promise which either
resolves or fails with a response object consisting of *code* and
*data*. This promise should resolve in the case of successful execution,
and it should be rejected in the case of an error. Pass the relevant
code along with the promises:

```javascript
return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
 /* Success
  resolve({
      code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.SUCCESS,
      data: {...}
  }); */

 /* Failure
  reject({
      code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.FAIL,
      data: {...}
  }); */
}
```


## User Profiles

The user profile callback allows the user to specify user profile
details such as first name, last name, and email address. By default, if
you do not register a user profile callback, the user name is displayed
as "Guest" in the comments panel.

![User being referred to as guest](../images/userprofile_new.png)

When the callback is registered, user annotations are associated with
the corresponding username.

![User being referred with correct username](../images/userprofile1.png)

**User profile callback signature**

```javascript
const profile = {
  userProfile: {
      name: <name of user>,
      firstName: <first name>,
      lastName: <last name>,
      email: <user email>
  }
};

adobeDCView.registerCallback(
   AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.GET_USER_PROFILE_API,
   function() {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         resolve({
            code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.SUCCESS,
            data: profile
         });
      });
   },
{});
```

## User settings

Users can update the color of an annotation by clicking on the PDF
annotation and changing the color from the toolbar. The updated color
is applied to all new annotations of that type added to the PDF. Also,
when any annotation tool is selected for the first
time, there is a coach mark displayed to educate users about the
annotation tool which goes away after a few seconds.

<InlineAlert slots="text" />

Previously, the default implementation of these user preferences was
that the browser used to remember the updated annotation color and
also whether the coach mark for a selected annotation tool has been
displayed or not. This was achieved by storing this data in the local
storage of the PDF Embed API domain. This is now deprecated and PDF
Embed API does not store this data.

By default, these preferences are lost when the PDF reloads. As a
result, the updated annotation color is not remembered (default
annotation color will be applied in this case) and users will see
annotation tool coach marks again when the PDF reloads.

Website developers can improve this experience by registering the user
setting callbacks. There are two callbacks involved:

-   SET\_USER\_SETTING\_API: This callback saves user-specific settings.
-   GET\_USER\_SETTING\_API: This callback fetches the current user
    setting.

Developers can provide their own implementation using these callbacks
and save the user preferences wherever they like.

**User settings callback signature**

```javascript
adobeDCView.registerCallback(
   AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.SET_USER_SETTING_API,
   function(setting) {
      /* Add your custom implementation here to save the user setting */
      ...
      ...
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         resolve({
            code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.SUCCESS
         });
      });
   },
{});


adobeDCView.registerCallback(
   AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.GET_USER_SETTING_API,
   function() {
      /* Fetch the user setting */
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         resolve({
            code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.SUCCESS,
            data: {
               setting: <USER_STORED_SETTING>
            }
         });
      });
   },
{});
```

Find the working code sample
[here](https://www.adobe.com/go/pdfembedapi_samples) under
`/More Samples/Save User Preferences/`. In this code sample, the user
setting callbacks are used to save the user preferences in the local
storage of the website domain. Using this implementation, the browser
remembers the updated annotation color and also shows the coach mark
only once for every annotation tool in the current browser.

This is only an example and it is up to the website developer how they
do the actual implementation of saving the user preferences.

## Save a PDF

The Save button on the top bar is not visible unless the PDF is
modified: it only becomes active after PDF modification (there are
changes to actually save). For example, when `showAnnotationTools` is
true, users can add an annotation or comment, and you can provide them
with the option to save the modified PDF to a local or networked
location.

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

A user cannot add comments or edit PDF files that are secure,
protected, or read-only. The annotation tools as well as the save
button are hidden for such files.

Note that while the Save button is hidden by default, you can show the
button even when there are no changes to save by setting
`showDisabledSaveButton` to *true* and passing it as a preview
configuration to the `previewFile` API. In this case, the save button
appears in disabled state until the PDF is modified.

```javascript
{
  showDisabledSaveButton: <Boolean, default=false>,
}
```
    
### Save callback

This callback allows users to save the updated PDF buffer which can then
be stored in an external file storage system.

-   **If you do not register a callback**: When any annotation is added to the PDF, 
    a download button appears in the top bar. Click on the download button to save
    the updated PDF to the userâ€™s local machine. 
    The default location is often the Downloads folder.
-   **If you do register a callback**: When any annotation is added to the PDF, 
    a save button appears in the top bar. Your code can enable saving the
    modified document to an external file storage system like OneDrive
    or Google Drive. In this case, the code varies with the website
    developerâ€™s implementation.

Users can trigger the save functionality by either clicking on the
**Save** or **Download** button manually or by pressing **Ctrl+S** on the keyboard. You
should register the callback to receive the modified file content when
the user initiates the save.

To control the save callback behavior, you can pass the following
options:

-   `autoSaveFrequency`: Optional. Default value is 0. The save callback
    supports auto-saving so that manual saving is not required. The
    value is the time in seconds after which the PDF is auto-saved if
    there are any unsaved changes and no other annotation changes are
    made in the meantime. Using this configuration, the document is
    saved even if the user does not manually save. You must set this
    parameter to a numeric value greater than 0.
-   `enableFocusPolling`: Optional. Default value is false. When true, a
    PDF with unsaved changes is auto-saved whenever the user focus
    shifts from the current PDF preview (for example, by opening a new
    tab in the same browser). When false, auto-save does not happen. Set
    this parameter to true if you want this to work.
-   `showSaveButton`: Optional. Default value is true. Set this to false
    if you don't want the save button to be displayed at all, not even
    when the PDF is modified. When set to false, the save button is
    never displayed and save operation will be done through auto-save or
    through the keyboard by pressing Ctrl+S.

The second callback parameter is a JavaScript function returning a
Promise which either resolves or fails with a response object containing
code and data. The function parameters include:

-   `metaData`: Information about the file
-   `content`: The ArrayBuffer of file content
-   `options`: (optional) Additional user options passed to the function
    to control its behavior in certain cases. For instance, the `saveAs`
    option is passed here when the current user saves a copy of a
    changed PDF when multiple users are modifying the same file (See the
    FILE\_MODIFIED case below).

**Save callback signature**

```javascript
const saveOptions = {
   autoSaveFrequency: <Number, default=0>,
   enableFocusPolling: <Boolean, default=false>,
   showSaveButton: <Boolean, default=true>
}

adobeDCView.registerCallback(
   AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.SAVE_API,
   function(metaData, content, options) {
      /* Add your custom save implementation here...and based on that resolve or reject response in given format */
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         resolve({
            code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.SUCCESS,
            data: {
               /* Updated file metadata after successful save operation */
               metaData: <File MetaData>
            }
         });
      });
   },
   saveOptions
);
```

The website developer can write their own save implementation in this
function and should send the response object with the appropriate code
and data in the following format:

-   SUCCESS: Use this response code to denote a successful save
    operation where the response data contains the updated file
    metadata.
-   FAIL: Use the FAIL response code when the save API fails. Response
    data is optional in this case. The user will see an error popup and
    should retry saving.

![Generic Error Message](../images/fail.png)

<br/>

-   FILE\_MODIFIED: Use the response code FILE\_MODIFIED to capture the case when two users
simultaneously modify a single PDF. This case only occurs for shared
files. The save functionality will fail for the current user if the file
content has been previously modified by another user. The response data
will contain the name and email of the other user modifying the same
file.

In this scenario, the current user sees a popup with two options:

-   **Save a copy**: Choosing the **Save a copy** button initiates the
    save callback again and saves a copy of the PDF with the current
    userâ€™s changes. The `{saveAs: true}` option is passed to the
    `options` parameter of the function to denote that a new PDF is
    saved.
-   **Discard my changes**: Discards the current userâ€™s changes and
    reloads the PDF.

![File Modified message](../images/file_modified.png)

**Save callback**

```javascript
/* Options to control save behavior */
const saveOptions = {
   autoSaveFrequency: <Number, default=0>,
   enableFocusPolling: <Boolean, default=false>,
   showSaveButton: <Boolean, default=true>
}

/* Register save callback */
adobeDCView.registerCallback(
   AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.SAVE_API,
   function(metaData, content, options) {
      /* Write down your own save implementation here... and based on that resolve or reject response in given format */
      /* Save callback success case */
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         resolve({
            code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.SUCCESS,
            data: {
              metaData: Object.assign(metaData, {fileName: <UPDATED_FILE_NAME>})
            }
         });
      });

     /* Save callback failure case */
     /* return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
           reject({
              code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.FAIL,
              data: {
                 <Optional>
              }
           });
        }); */

     /* Save callback file modified case */
     /* return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
           resolve({
              code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.FILE_MODIFIED,
              data: {
                 modifiedBy: {
                   name: <Username of the user who modified the file>,
                   mail: <Email of the user who modified the file>,
                 }
              }
           });
        }); */
   },
   saveOptions);
```

## Status callback

The status callback allows you to poll the status of the file to check
whether the currently open file is changed by another user or not. This
file status polling occurs after a fixed interval of time defined in the
`filePollFrequency` option. Use both the save and status callbacks
together to achieve the complete save experience including auto-save and
file status polling.

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

While you can specify additional options to control the status
callback, both `autoSaveFrequency` and `enableFocusPolling` are
deprecated for the status callback. Developers are advised to use
these options with the save callback.

-   `filePollFrequency`: Optional. Default value is 10 seconds. The time
    in seconds after which the file is polled for changes. To disable
    file status polling, set `filePollFrequency` to 0. By default, file
    status polling starts when there are unsaved changes made in the PDF
    by the current user.
-   `keepPolling`: Optional. Default value is false (boolean). Set
    `keepPolling` to true if you want file status polling to work
    continuously even if there are no unsaved changes made to the file
    by the current user. The frequency of the file status polling is
    governed by the time specified in `filePollFrequency`.

**Status callback signature**

```javascript
const statusOptions = {
   filePollFrequency: <Number, default=10>,
   keepPolling: <Boolean, default=false>
};

adobeDCView.registerCallback(
   AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.STATUS_API,
   function(metaData) {
      /* Resolve or reject response in given format */
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         resolve({
            code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.SUCCESS,
            data: {
               <Optional>
            }
          });
       });
    },
    statusOptions
);
```

The second parameter of the callback is a JavaScript function returning
a Promise which either resolves or fails with a response object
containing a code and data. `metaData` is the only function parameter,
and it refers to the file information. The response code in the Promise
can take either SUCCESS or FILE\_MODIFIED:

SUCCESS: Use the response code SUCCESS to denote successful file polling
and that the file has no changes made by another user. Response data is
optional here.

FILE\_MODIFIED: Use the response code FILE\_MODIFIED to capture the case
of conflicting updates made by another user in a file sharing scenario.
Response data will contain the name and email of the other user
modifying the same file. Note the following:

-   If the Promise returns FILE\_MODIFIED when the current user has not
    changed the file, that denotes that the file was already modified by
    another user and the current user is viewing an old version of the
    file. The user sees a popup with the "Get Latest Version" option
    which will reload the latest version of the file.

![Get Latest Version message](../images/getlatest.png)
<br/>

-   If the Promise returns FILE\_MODIFIED after the current user has
    changed the file, that denotes that two users are modifying the same
    file simultaneously. In this scenario, the current user sees a popup
    with two options: **Save a copy** saves a copy of the PDF with the
    current userâ€™s changes while **Discard my changes** discards the
    current userâ€™s changes and reloads the PDF.

![Conflict On Save message](../images/saveconflict.png)

**Status callback**

```javascript
const statusOptions = {
       filePollFrequency: <Number, default=10>,
       keepPolling: <Boolean, default=false>
    };

    adobeDCView.registerCallback(
       AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.STATUS_API,
       function(metaData) {
          /* Resolve or reject response in given format */
          /* Status callback success case */
          return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
             resolve({
                code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.SUCCESS,
             });
          });

          /* Status callback file modified case */
          /* return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                resolve({
                   code: AdobeDC.View.Enum.ApiResponseCode.FILE_MODIFIED,
                   data: {
                      modifiedBy: {
                         name: <Username of the user who modified the file>,
                         mail: <Email of the user who modified the file>,
                      }
                   }
                });
             }); */
       },
       statusOptions
    );
```

## Viewer API

The PDF Embed API provides a number of viewer APIs for customizing the
user interface and user interactions with the PDF. These APIs can be
used to perform UI customizations programmatically at run-time.

### GetAPIs Interface

The getAPIs interface allows you to invoke any of the viewer APIs as
follows:

```html

        var previewFilePromise = adobeDCView.previewFile({
         content:   {location: {url: "https://documentservices.adobe.com/view-sdk-demo/PDFs/Bodea Brochure.pdf"}},
           metaData:  {fileName: "Bodea Brochure.pdf"}
     });

     previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
     adobeViewer.getAPIs().then(apis => {
          // All viewer APIs can be invoked here
      });
    });
  });
 </script>
</body>
</html>
```

#### setZoomLevel

This API accepts a float value as input and sets the zoom level of the
PDF to that value. The input must lie between the minimum and maximum
allowed zoom levels of the PDF.

If the input passed is less than the minimum zoom level, then the
minimum zoom level is applied to the PDF. Similarly, if the input passed
is greater than the maximum zoom level, then the maximum zoom level is
applied.

                        .then(result => console.log(result))
                        .catch(error => console.log(error));
        });
});
```

<hr />

### Search APIs

This API can be used to search for a term in the PDF programmatically.
This API is supported in all embed modes.

In order to enable search APIs, the configuration variable
`enableSearchAPIs` should be set to true and passed as a preview
configuration to the `previewFile` API.

          });
       });
  });
 </script>
</body>
</html>
```

<InlineAlert slots="text"/>

The document search option is not available in UI when search APIs are enabled.

The search API takes a search term of String value as input and searches
for that term in the entire document. The first occurrence of the search
term is highlighted in the PDF, starting from the current page in view.

##### Input parameters

<SEARCH_STRING: String>

##### API output

Returns a Promise which, 

* Resolves with a JSON object containing the following interfaces:
  - `onResultsUpdate()`
  - `next()`
  - `previous()`
  - `clear()`
* Rejects with an error object that includes a code and message.

##### API signature 

```
previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
        adobeViewer.getAPIs().then(apis => {
                apis.search(<SEARCH_STRING>)
                        .then(searchObject => console.log(searchObject))
                        .catch(error => console.log(error));
        });
});
```

<hr />

#### onResultsUpdate

Users can register a callback function and pass as an input to the
`onResultsUpdate()` function. This callback function will be triggered
every time a search operation takes place through the search API and the
search result is highlighted in the PDF. The callback function will
receive important information about the current search result in the
form of a JSON. The JSON will include information such as current page
number, current search result index, total number of search results and
status.

```javascript
{
    currentResult: {
        pageNumber: Integer,  // Current page number in view
        index: Integer,       // Index of the current highlighted search result
    },
    totalResults: Integer,   // Total number of search results found till the time callback function is executed
    status: String           // Status of search result till the time callback function is executed. Values can be "IN_PROGRESS" or "COMPLETED".
}
```
 
##### Input parameters

N/A

##### API output

Returns a Promise which, 

* Resolves to true on successful operation. When operation is successful, the callback function is executed and receives information about the search results in the form of a JSON. Resolves to false when `onResultsUpdate()` operation fails.
* Rejects with an error object that includes a code and message.

##### API signature 

```
function callbackFunction(searchResult) {
        console.log("Current search result: ", searchResult);
}

previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
        adobeViewer.getAPIs().then(apis => {
                apis.search(<SEARCH_STRING>).then(searchObject => {
                        searchObject.onResultsUpdate(callbackFunction)
                                .then(result => console.log(result))
                                .catch(error => console.log(error));
                })
                .catch(error => console.log(error));
        });
});
```    

<hr />

### Attachment APIs

These APIs access the existing attachments in the PDF programmatically.

#### getAttachments

This API returns the list of existing attachments in the PDF. Each
attachment item in this list is represented as a JSON containing
important information such as name, mime type, description, creation
date and modified date.

```javascript
{
    name: String         // Name of the attachment file
    description: String, // Description of the attachment
    mimeType: String     // Mime type of the attachment file
    created: Date        // Date when the attachment was created
    modified: Date       // Date when the attachment was modified
}
```
   
##### Input parameters

N/A

##### API output

Returns a Promise which, 

* Resolves with the list of attachments available in the PDF: `[ Attachment_1, Attachment_2,...]`
* Every attachment item in this list will contain information such as `name`, `description`, `mimeType`, `created` and `modified`.
* Rejects with an error object that includes a code and message.

### getXMPMetadata

XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) is a technology developed by Adobe
which provides a common XML framework to store metadata in digital
documents. XMP Metadata includes information about the document and its
contents, such as the author's name, keywords, and copyright
information.

`getXMPMetadata` checks the PDF for XMP metadata and returns it if
present. The API accepts two optional input parameters.

-   The first optional input parameter takes a list of XMP metadata
    fields. The API returns the values of only these fields. If no field
    is passed, then it returns the default field values.
-   The second optional input parameter takes a boolean value. If
    *true*, the API will also return the complete XMP metadata stream.
    The default value is *false*.
    
##### Input parameters

`(fields = [<field1>, <field2>, ...], includeRawStream = <Boolean>)`

##### API output

Returns a Promise which, 

* Resolves with the JSON object containing the XMP metadata and XML stream (if `includeRawStream` is set to true) if successful: `{ xmpMetadata: <XMP_METADATA>, xmpStream: <XML> }`
* Rejects with an error object that includes a code and message.

##### API signature 

```
	
const fields = ["dc:title", "dc:creator", "xmp:CreateDate"];
const includeRawStream = true;
previewFilePromise.then(adobeViewer => {
        adobeViewer.getAPIs().then(apis => {
                apis.getXMPMetadata(fields, includeRawStream)
                        .then(result => console.log(result))
                        .catch(error => console.log(error));
